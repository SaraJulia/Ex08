All the weary mothers of the earth will finally rest 
We will take their babies in our arms and do our best 
When the sun is low upon the field 
To love and music they will yield 
And the weary mothers of the earth shall rest

And the farmer on his tractor and beside his plow 
Will stand there in confusion as we wet his brow 
With the tears of all the businessmen 
Who see what they have done to him 
And the weary farmers of the earth shall rest

And the aching workers of the world again shall sing 
These words in mighty choruses to all will bring 
"We shall no longer be the poor 
For no one owns us anymore" 
And the workers of the world again shall sing

And when the soldiers burn their uniforms in every land 
The foxholes at the borders will be left unmanned 
General, when you come for the review 
The troops will have forgotten you 
And the men and women of the earth shall rest

At night in the safety of shadows and numbers 
Seeking some turf on which nothing encumbers 
The buying and selling of casual looks 
Stuff that gets printed in x-rated books 
Your mother might have tried to understand 
When you were hardly your daddy's little man 
And you gave up saluting the chief 
To find yourself some relief

Finely plucked eyebrows and skin of satin 
Smiling seductive and endlessly Latin 
Olympic body on dancing feet 
Perfume thickening the air like heat 
A transient star of gay bar fame 
You quit your job and changed your name 
And you're nearly beyond belief 
As you hunt down a little relief

The seven foot black with the emerald ring 
Broke up a fight without saying a thing 
As the cops cruised by wanting one more chance 
To send Jimmy Baldwin back over to France 
And a trucker with kids and a wife 
Prefers to spend half of his life 
In early Bohemian motif 
Playing pool and getting relief

My favorite couple was looking so fine 
Dancing in rhythm and laughing in rhyme 
In the light of the jukebox all yellow and blue 
Holding each other as young lovers do 
To me they will always remain 
Unshamed, untamed, and unblamed 
The altar boy and the thief 
Grabbing themselves some relief

The altar boy and the thief 
Catching a little relief

Bangladesh, Bangladesh 
Bangladesh, Bangladesh 
When the sun sinks in the west 
Die a million people of the Bangladesh

The story of Bangladesh 
Is an ancient one again made fresh 
By blind men who carry out commmands 
Which flow out of the laws upon which nation stands 
Which is to sacrifice a people for a land

Bangladesh, Bangladesh 
Bangladesh, Bangladesh 
When the sun sinks in the west 
Die a million people of the Bangladesh

Once again we stand aside 
And watch the families crucified 
See a teenage mother's vacant eyes 
As she watches her feeble baby try 
To fight the monsoon rains and the cholera flies

And the students at the university 
Asleep at night quite peacefully 
The soldiers came and shot them in their beds 
And terror took the dorm awakening shrieks of dread 
And silent frozen forms and pillows drenched in red

Bangladesh, Bangladesh 
Bangladesh, Bangladesh 
When the sun sinks in the west 
Die a million people of the Bangladesh

Did you read about the army officer's plea 
For donor's blood? It was given willingly 
By boys who took the needles in their veins 
And from their bodies every drop of blood was drained 
No time to comprehend and there was little pain

And so the story of Bangladesh 
Is an ancient one again made fresh 
By all who carry out commands 
Which flow out of the laws upon which nations stand 
Which say to sacrifice a people for a land

Bangladesh, Bangladesh 
Bangladesh, Bangladesh 
When the sun sinks in the west 
Die a million people of the Bangladesh

e've watched them leaving, seen their ragged flight 
Children of the jungle, mothers of the night 
A boy of ten by the roadside lies 
Hears his future in whispers and cries 
And clutching a tiny Buddha charm 
A baby dies in his mother's arms

Is there only sorrow in Cambodia? 
Is there no tomorrow in Cambodia?

Leaving the graves of your ancestors after a thousand years 
Leaving a few belongings after a thousand tears 
How come you never left before through bombing, famine and flood? 
Are the rivers useless now spilling over with blood?

Is there only sorrow in Cambodia? 
Is there no tomorrow in Cambodia?

I hear there are very few children from ages one to five 
It takes more than jungle leaves to keep the young ones alive 
I hear some of the rice got through the outside's trying to send to you 
There you sit in the ruins of war, the doctors are waiting at your door

And we will try and feed you, try and go to you 
People of Kampuchea, Cambodia

A little way in from the border in the crowded camps 
I've seen mothers giving birth, seen beautiful orphans dance 
An old man turns and covers his eyes, he was never supposed to cry 
With sons and daughters and home and wife 
Taken from him in his autumn life

Should we try and feed you, say hello to you 
Old man of Kampuchea, Kampuchea, Cambodia

Call another conference, write another song 
Deliver another ton of rice and hope it gets where it belongs 
And rival teams of bandits are really the only choice 
Even if the people had their bellies filled, even if the people had a voice

And meanwhile, lovers are caught in the crossfire 
Children are caught in the barbed wire 
Military sinks in the mire 
Let me show it to you

Is there only sorrow, only sorrow in Cambodia? 
Is there no tomorrow, no tomorrow in Cambodia? 
Still we'll try and feed you, try and show to you 
People of Kampuchea, Kampuchea, Cambodia

In the month of May, in the glory of the day 
Came the descendants of a hundred flowers 
And their fight it did begin with the aging Mandarin 
And they fought with an extraordinary power 
Everyone was smiling, their hearts were one 
In Tiananmen Square

But it seems that the Spring this year in Beijing 
Came just before the Fall 
There was no summer at all 
In Tiananmen Square 
China... China

There's peace in the emerald fields, there's mist upon the lakes 
But something is afoot in the People's Hall 
The spirit of Chu Ping is alive in young Chai Ling 
And the Emperor has his back against the wall 
Black sun rising over Tiananmen Square 
Over Tiananmen Square

But it seems that the Spring this year in Beijing 
Came just before the Fall 
There was no summer at all 
In Tiananmen Square 
China... China

In the month of June, in the darkness of the moon 
Went the descendants of a hundred flowers 
And time may never tell how many of them fell 
Like the petals of a rose in some satanic shower 
Everyone was weeping in all of China 
And Tiananmen Square

But it seems that the Spring this year in Beijing 
Came just before the Fall 
There was no summer at all 
In Tiananmen Square 
China... China

And even the moon on the fourth day of June 
Hid her face and did not see 
Black sun rising over Tiananmen Square

And Wang Wei Lin, you remember him 
All alone he stood before the tanks 
A shadow of forgotten ancestors in Tiananmen Square

And my blue-eyed son, you had no one 
You could call a hero of your age 
You have the rainbow warriors of Tiananmen Square, singing 
China Shall Be Free 
China Shall Be Free 
China Shall Be Free

Coconuts sitting in my hand 
Remindin' me of my island man 
And my island man sitting in his hut 
Dreamin' about my coconuts

Coconuts floating in the sea 
I remember you, I remember me 
Coconuts dancing in the sand 
And I'm in love again with my island man

Coconut milk is like a stream 
That comes from the mountain pure and clean 
And the man he comes to drink it up 
Never tires of the taste of those coconuts

Coconuts floating in the sea 
I remember you, I remember me 
Coconuts dancing in the sand 
And I'm in love again with my island man

Coconut flavor sweet and mild 
Remindin' me of my island child 
And my island child all grown up 
Out in the carnival of life jugglin' coconuts

Coconuts floating in the sea 
I remember you, I remember me 
Coconuts dancing in the sand 
And I'm in love again with my island man
